# Notes

So this is going to be a Templated, Timed To-Do List
Templated: you can create an example of to-do list, give it a name
Each task can be given a time, a name, and be put in a list. Other commands: complete, delete.
Each list can be renamed, launched, or have the order changed.

        function(parameter1, parameter2)
            result = parameter1 + parameter2
            print result
            return result
